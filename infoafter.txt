‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL USAGE NOTES & LIMITATIONS
----------------------------------------

üö´ DOES NOT SUPPORT MODERN TUNNELING PLATFORMS  
- You **must use your own local IP (IPv4)**  
- Tools like `playit.gg`, `Ngrok`, and `localhost.run` **do not work reliably**  
  with this RAT unless modified ‚Äî due to SSL & tunneling conflicts

üí° HOW TO GET YOUR IP:
Open CMD and run:
    ipconfig

Copy your **IPv4 Address** (e.g. 192.168.1.5)  
Use this in the builder instead of 127.0.0.1 or external links.

---

üìµ DOES NOT WORK ON ANDROID 13 & 14 FULLY  
- APK may install on Android 12  
- **Permissions must be granted manually** by user (camera, mic, location)
- On Android 13+ or 14, many features **will break** without proper patching
- Tested working on Android 9 to 12

---

üîê APK SIZE MAY LOOK SMALL (~294 KB)  
- The payload is minimal but functional  
- Logs, connection info, and build logic are still active  
- Confirm `.apk` has `classes.dex` inside by renaming to `.zip`

---

üí° FIREWALL & NETWORK ISSUES:
- Your firewall or antivirus may block port 1337  
- Open the required port manually via Windows Firewall settings
- Run MongoDB with:
    mongod
- Then start PROJECT BUILDER panel (EXE or `npm start`)

---

üóÉ WHERE IS THE BUILT APK?
- After clicking **Build** in the APK tab  
  ‚Üí Your `.apk` will be saved in:
    `C:\Users\<yourname>\AhMyth\Output\ProjectBuilder-aligned.apk`

---

‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE ON FUNCTIONALITY:
- This builder is UI-optimized but still built on AhMyth‚Äôs original engine
- All logic is preserved ‚Äî but newer Android versions require deep patching
- This is not a full spyware, but a PoC (Proof of Concept RAT) for local testing
